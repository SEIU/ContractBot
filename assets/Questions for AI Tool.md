Improving Existing Bargaining Language (new category\!):

- What trigger mechanisms (such as a cost-of-living index or funding changes) could we add to this reopener clause to ensure wage talks happen when needed, while addressing management’s concern about frequent renegotiation? “Either party may reopen wage negotiations once every six (6) months upon 15 days’ written notice to the other party. If neither party invokes this reopener during a given interval, the wage provisions of the agreement remain in effect.”
- How could we improve this clause to cover rotating shifts or to increase the differential for extreme hours (e.g., after midnight): “Employees shall receive a night shift differential equal to ten percent (10%) of their basic hourly rate for all time worked between 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. A night differential shall not be paid when an employee works during this period as a result of the employee’s personal request (e.g. a voluntary shift swap)”
- Suggest ways to expand this language to encourage continued education: “Nurses who have obtained an approved professional certification shall receive a premium of one dollar ($1.00) per hour in addition to their regular pay. Each nurse is eligible for only one certification premium regardless of multiple certifications. Similarly, employees in other classifications who attain and utilize advanced certifications or licenses (e.g. bilingual fluency, technical certifications) may receive a designated stipend or percentage increase as listed in the pay appendix.”
- What other protections could we consider for unpredictable schedules to this bargaining language? “In the event the Employer changes a regular employee’s posted schedule or shift assignment with fewer than five (5) days notice for reasons other than another employee’s absence or leave, the affected employee shall receive a premium of one-and-one-half times their regular rate (1.5x pay) for all hours worked on the first shift of the new schedule. If the change is made with less than 48 hours notice due to another bargaining unit employee utilizing contractual leave (e.g., calling out sick on short notice), the affected employee will receive a premium of $0.85 per hour in addition to their regular pay for the first shift worked under the changed schedule. These premiums compensate employees for the inconvenience of last-minute changes. An employee may agree in writing to waive the premium for a specific change (e.g., if they initiate a swap), but otherwise it shall be automatic.”
- To strengthen this, what enforcement or penalty could we add if the employer chronically understaffs, and how might we address emergency circumstances? “The Employer agrees to maintain staffing levels that ensure a safe working environment and safe patient care at all times. Staffing plans (including nurse-to-patient ratios or employee-per-task levels) shall not be unilaterally reduced if such reduction would compromise employee or client safety. Any proposed changes to established staffing guidelines must be reviewed and approved by the joint safety or staffing committee. The Employer will make every effort to provide sufficient staffing so that employees can take mandated breaks and days off without endangering safety or workload. For example, the Employer commits to refrain from assigning more patients or workload to an individual than outlined in the safe staffing plan (e.g., not assigning a charge nurse additional patients beyond the plan). Persistent failure to meet agreed staffing levels can be grieved and remedied through expedited arbitration if necessary.”
